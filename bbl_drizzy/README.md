# BBL Drizzy Soundbanks

Inspired by possibly the greatest rap beef of all time, the BBL Drizzy Soundbank set is an exceedingly simple mod. I picked my five favorite BBL Drizzies and made them into a soundbank for Dynamic Music. I *think* these soundbanks may work with MUSE2 as well, let me know if they don't and I'll see what I can do.

## Usage

<!-- Really should have a link to DM here as well -->
BBL Drizzy Soundbanks requires Dynamic Music For OpenMW-Lua, which in turn, requires OpenMW 0.49. These soundbanks are built for Dynamic Music version 11, which is still current as of OpenMW-cd116ebe5f.
