BaseParryFramesName: Base Parry Frame Count
BaseParryFramesDesc: |-
  Starting number of parrying frames granted regardless of character skill or shield weight.

BaseShieldFramesName: Base Shield Parry Frames
BaseShieldFramesDesc: |-
  When parrying, every shield grants N parry frames, which then has a fraction of the shield's weight subtracted from it.
  For example, the default value of this setting is 8, and the Per Unit Shield Weight Penalty's Default value is 3. 
  With default settings and a shield weighing 15 units, you would get 3 additional parry frames from your equipped shield.

BlockFrameMultName: Block Skill Parry Frame Multiplier
BlockFrameMultDesc: |-
  When parrying, the character's block skill is capped to 100, and then flattened to a value between 0 and 1.
  That is then multiplied by the number value of this setting, granting somewhere between 0-1 * N additional parry frames based on the block skill.

MaxParryFramesName: Maximum Parry Frames
MaxParryFramesDesc: |-
  Maximum number of parry frames. Higher numbers mean parries will be easier, where lower is more punishing.

MinParryFramesName: Minimum Parry Frames
MinParryFramesDesc: |-
  Minimum number of parry frames. Higher numbers mean parries will be easier, where lower is more punishing.

ParryGroupName: Parry Configuration Settings

PerUnitShieldWeightPenaltyName: Per Unit Shield Weight Penalty
PerUnitShieldWeightPenaltyDesc: |-
  Divisor on shield weight when calculating parry frames. 
  At a value of 3, a shield weighing 9 units will subtract 3 from the base shield frames setting to determine the number of parry frames given by a particular shield.
