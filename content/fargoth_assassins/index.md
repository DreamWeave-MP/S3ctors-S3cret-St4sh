Well, by now the jig is up.

This mod is a small extension for AFFA's mod, [Fargoth Says Hello](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52751). 

At a certain point in the mod's questline, the player *might* get into a fight with Fargoth. If they do, and they run away, Fargoth will send assassins after them until they come back to finish the job.

<!-- more -->

Fargoth's assassins can be of any (vanilla) race or gender, and will copy any random local NPC's inventory. You probably won't notice them! Until it's too late . . .
