# Luamics

Luamics is a simple global script that adds a chance for any chest encountered in-game to be replaced by a mimic chest. Mimic chests will retain their original loot, and spawn at a rate of 5%. Chests which are scripted, owned, or have `trader` in their record id are ineligible to be converted to mimics, so the script *should* be relatively safe. Should be, that is.
