# S3ui

S3ui is an early iteration at an attempt to replace OpenMW's user interface entirely, with the transmog mod as a foundation.
In retrospect, I have found the architecture of Transmog to be overall, a total disaster, and am not really sure if I want to continue developing this mod based on it. Still, this mod itself is distinct from Transmog and is thus available on the St4sh. Don't expect much at the moment, however.
