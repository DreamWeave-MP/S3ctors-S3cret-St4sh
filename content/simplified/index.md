## Headings link to and from the table of contents.

Why walk when you can float? The Telvanni magister demanded a treatise on levitation. His tower grew impatient. The parchment sprouted fungal caps.
The margins crawled with nix-hounds, their grammar all bite and no bark.
The footnote reads: "See also: plummeting, sudden."

# Contents Are

The alchemist's manual devolved into a list. Hackle-Lo leaf, marshmerrow, scuttle... and then, for ten pages, just the word "skooma" written in increasingly frantic, spidery script.

The final page is a single golden stain, shaped vaguely like a sinking sun.

A helpful cartouche labels it: "Perfect clarity."

## Generated Up To

A bard's tale from Skyrim, translated poorly. The words "cheese," "shout," and "dragon" appear with unreasonable frequency.

The syntax is battered, as if by a great warhammer.

Whole passages are just the sound a Nord makes before a fight, spelled out phonetically. It smells of mead and regret.

### Heading 3

The Black Horse Courier's rejected obituary. "He died as he lived: annoyingly," it begins.
It details a fatal misunderstanding with a Guar, a misplaced intervention by a Daedric Prince of minor ridicule, and a funeral procession disrupted by a surprisingly eloquent mudcrab.

The tone is inappropriately jaunty. It is the most accurate document in all Tamriel.
