# Fargoth Assassins

Well, by now the jig is up.

This mod is a small extension for AFFA's mod, [Fargoth Says Hello](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52751). 

At a certain point in the mod's questline, the player *might* get into a fight with Fargoth. If they do, and they run away, Fargoth will send assassins after them until they come back to finish the job.

Fargoth's assassins can be of any (vanilla) race or gender, and will copy any random local NPC's inventory. You probably won't notice them! Until it's too late . . .
