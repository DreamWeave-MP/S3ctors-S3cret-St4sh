Description
************
This is a complete set of OFFICIAL pre-release skill icons for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, pieced together and converted to .DDS. These were originally featured on Bethesda's own Elder Scrolls Codex webpage to showcase the game's skills leading up to release. Similar icons for spells and attributes can be seen in pre-release mockups distributed in press kits.

They feature much higher contrast, vibrant gradients, have a distinct banner motif on their left side, and are of a higher resolution than the final versions.

Provided as a simple replacer mod and community resource.

BONUS: Pre-release Waterbreathing spell icon presumably from the same set. Visible in some pre-release mockups. Unused under Morrowind.BSA/Book Art/b_tx_s_water_breath.dds. Available in higher quality .bmp from the Construction Set.
