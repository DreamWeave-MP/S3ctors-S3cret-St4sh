It has a hard requirement for OpenMW 0.50, due to extensive use of its onHit feature.\nAt its core, CHIM is a highly advanced damage scaing mod, taking many factors into account. There are four core systems in CHIM:\nDynamic Stat Management - CHIM completely takes over management of fatigue capacity and regeneration for all actors, whilst also managing caps on health and magicka. Because of the popularity of existing magicka regeneration mods and the lack of sense in doing health regeneration at all, CHIM doesn't attempt to modify regeneration for these stats.\nBlocking &amp; Parrying - CHIM features active blocking with shields, and properly timed blocks can trigger a parry against your opponent, leaving them open for an attack.\nPoise - Ripped 1:1 from Dark Souls 1, CHIM features an equipment-based poise system rewarding heavier gear. When one's poise is broken, they're knocked down, rendering them unable to attack and more vulnerable to damage.\nCrits, Fumbles, and Damage Scaling - With CHIM, every attack always hits. To compensate for this whilst keeping weapon skills useful, incoming attack damage is scaled according to one's hit chance. For example, if your strike would normally have had 64% chance to hit, then, whatever damage you do will be 64% as effective. Alternatively, if you have a very high hit chance, such as 125%, you will do additional damage and be rewarded. To make things even more interesting, any actor may critically strike or fumble there attack at a configurable rate.\nSee each subsystem's respective section for details on what each one does and how to configure it. Each subsystem has its own settings page within the mod, all of which may be localized. In formulae shown in the documentation, every variable starting with a capital letter is a setting, such as EnableCritFumble.\nRequirements\nDownload the mod from Here\nExtract the zip to a location of your choosing.\nPaste the location you extracted it to into the form below, hit Generate Config, and paste the result into openmw.cfg.\nWhere would you like to install this mod?\nGenerate Config\nCopy Config to Clipboard\nDynamic Stats\nCHIM alters the maximum capacity of all dynamic stats, and takes over fatigue regeneration completely. This is primarily to rebalance the combat experience and lower stat values out of the box. In most cases, vanilla formulae are reproduced and simply dehardcoded.\nFatigue\nCHIM overrides the vanilla fatigue capacity and regeneration formulae, setting relevant GMSTs to 0. Those GMSTs are renamed and exposed as settings in the mod.\nFatigue Regen\nFatigue Capacity\nMagicka\nCHIM Overrides the vanilla magicka capacity formula, but does not override its regeneration as this is well handled by other mods such as Pharis' Magicka Regen or Imperial Magicka Regen.\nMagicka Capacity\nHealth Capacity\nWhen A Hit Happens\nEvery hit will always be successful, as CHIM applies a massive fortify attack bonus to all actors. Sometimes this buff may be removed if an actor is resurrected or something similar - in such cases, CHIM will reapply the fortify attack bonus for their next strike.\nFirstly, if the victim of a strike is a player, CHIM checks if the player is currently able to parry. If a parry is currently possible, normal hit behavior is skipped and the attacker's animation is interrupted. This is your chance to strike! See the parrying section for more details.\nIf a parry isn't possible, but the player is blocking, damage mitigation is applied. The blocking section will contain more details, but shield damage mitigation is primarily derived from the shield's weight and raw armor value.\nAfter shield mitigation is calculated, the skill damage multiplier is derived. Basically, your hit chance is applied as a multiplier onto damage. This maintains the utility of weapon skill as it'll increase damage dealt as in later games, whilst allowing everyone to always strike successfully. See the Damage Scaling\nPoise damage is then calculated for every strike. CHIM's poise implementation is copied nearly 1:1 from Dark Souls 1, rewarding the use of more equipment slots and heavier gear. See the poise section for more details on how the poise system can be leveraged - but be aware for now, that, when a defender's poise is broken, they'll be knocked down, and take more damage.\nFinally, CHIM has a configurable global damage multiplier that is applied on top of block mitigation, hit chance multiplication, and poise multiplication, to magicka, health, and fatigue damage.\nThe final result looks something like this:\nFor more details, see each individual subsystem's documentation below and linked above. Each system's section explains its internal formulae, where each named variable is a setting within the mod.\nParrying\nWhen blocking, one may parry starting from the halfway point of the animation - approximately when the shield is at the center of your chest.\nTriggering a parry will activate all normal functions of a block, eg sounds, animations, et cetera, except for durability loss. Use this to your advantage! Also, if you are using my T4rg3t5 mod, a successful parry will cause the lock icon to bounce as it would when hitting a target, for additional feedback.\nMind that this speed will increase along with your character's stats as described in blocking, but what's important for this section is the parry window for each shield.\nTimings\nEvery shield is given a configurable number of parrying frames, based on a few of your character's attributes, and the weight of your shield.\nThe formula for calculating parry frames is as follows, with attributes capped at 100:\nThe parry frames granted are then converted to seconds, assuming a frame duration equal to 60FPS. So, when feeling out parry timings, assume timings are designed around 60FPS, because they are. Mind, this mod will work at high refresh rates, but timings were more reliable when hardcoding parry logic to 60FPS.\nOutgoing Damage\nWhen you parry an opponent, you'll deal a certain amount of their attack's damage back to them as fatigue damage. That formula is here:\nTo get the parry timings for your shield, do the following in the console:\nThis will give you the parry timings for your shield in frames and seconds, along with its recordId and size (used for damage).\nBlocking\nMake sure to bind a key for blocking, or it won't work at all! Blocking an attack will progress your block skill, damage your shield, consume fatigue, and mitigate incoming damage.\nDurability Damage\nAs simple as it gets:\nSee below for the damage mitigation formula.\nBlock Animation Speed\nIt's also worth mentioning that block animation speed is scaled according to various attributes of your character, including the weight of your carried shield. As before, assume all character attributes are capped at 100.\nThe point of this formula is to allow speedy characters to block faster, even if using heavier shields. However, exhaustion will still counteract the bonus from your stats, making gear and fatigue a more significant faster than raw agility.\nDamage Mitigation\nNaturally the most important part of blocking with a shield!\nThe resulting value is then multiplied directly with incoming damage.\nFatigue Consumption\nIt's worth mentioning this formula is derived directly from OpenMW source code, so this is exactly how block fatigue consumption already worked.\nPoise\nPoise is a system which determines your character's sturdiness and ability to \"tank\" incoming attacks.\nMechanically speaking, poise is a hidden meter, which refills entirely after not having been struck for a certain amount of time. Every time you're hit, this timer resets. When your poise is broken by an attack, you're knocked down and will take more damage (2x by default), resetting your poise timer and preventing further poise damage until you've recovered.\nPoise recovery time can be made faster by equipping more pieces of armoer. To increase your poise and be able to tank more hits, use heavier armor - or parry more and get hit less.\nMaximum Poise\nPoise Recovery Time\nPoise Damage\nCreatures, Weapons, and Hand-to-Hand attacks all cause different amounts of poise damage. Note that creatures with weapons will naturally use the weapon poise damage formula.\nUnarmed Creatures\nWeapons\nHand-to-Hand\nDamage Scaling\nSince CHIM uses the vanilla formula for calculating hit chance, I won't replicate it here. If you're curious, you may find it on the OpenMW Wiki. Be aware that this formula is used to calculate the damage multiplier on each hit, and that fortify attack bonuses are ignored since CHIM sets them to a drastically low value.\nCHIM's internal damage formula however, is still relevant.\nLuck plays an important factor in getting those critical hits, and in preventing fumbles. With default settings, a relatively skilled or lucky character generally shouldn't have to worry about fumbles - just massive incoming crits from enemy combatants.\nFlanking Damage\nWhen blocking, the angle between the attacker and defender's perspective is calculated. The result will be somewhere between 0 and 180, which is then used to calculate flanking damage.\nThe blocking angle is normalized from 0-180 to 0-1.0, and if it is greater than 0.333 (60 degrees), the attack was not blocked, and the defender is not knocked down, the normalized angle difference is added to the total multiplier for damaged dealt.\nTl;dr, being behind an opponent does an additional 100% damage, whereas being directly in front of them deals no additional damage. This is enabled by default as typically, the main victim of flanking attacks is actually you.\nFlanking damage is enabled by default, but may be disabled in CHIM's Damage settings page.\nEquipment Capacity\nAlso like Dark Souls, CHIM adds an equipment capacity system which works in tandem with Morrowind's existing carrying capacity system. Determining equipment capacity is dead simple:\nFormula\nHit Animation Speed\nEquipment capacity scales linearly with endurance, offering between 20% and 50% of your current carrying capacity. This is especially relevant for playing hit animations, whose speed scales according to your encumbrance:\nCreditsAll code in this repository was generated by Dave Corley under the GPL3 License.Please enjoy my content, hack away as you please, and respect the freedoms of your fellow creators in the meantime.Halbenull, for creating the original [CHIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45694?file_id=1000010292)You, for downloading this mod, and being the best."},{"url":"https://DreamWeave-MP.github.io/S3ctors-S3cret-St4sh/chim_climbing/","title":"CHIM Climbing","body":"CHIM Climbing is my own long-awaited attempt at porting the movement mechanics from the classic CHIM mod I worked on many years ago into OpenMW-Lua.

It contains all the same contents but saves some footguns in the API and makes certain calls more precise on your behalf, alongside being easier to introspect. This mod should be installed purely as a dependency of others, as it adds nothing on its own except an interface which other scripts may make use of. For scripters, read below to learn about how and why to make use of the s3lf interface.\nUsing the S3lf Module\nIt's a fairly common convention in Lua to use the keyword self in a table when it... needs to reference itself in some way. OpenMW-Lua subtly teaches you to use its own module openmw.self instead, which can break attempts to use the self keyword normally, induce subtle bugs, or just be plain weird. Additionally, the API overall is often considered too spread out or confusing to be easily used, with things like health being accessed like self.type.stats.dynamic.health(self). The s3lf module will save you these painful indexes with hidden implementation footguns, and allow you to use the self keyword as you normally would. Compare the normal version to s3lf.health.current.\nAny api function which takes self.object as its first argument now implicitly passes the SelfObject as the first argument. If the SelfObject is the only argument, then you do not even need to bother with the function call. The userdata values returned by the API are cached where possible and all flattened into the s3lf object. To best get a grip on it, just try using it in the Lua console!\nSome specific notes on how fields are changed:\nself.type is no longer accessible, as all fields inside of the .type field are flattened into s3lf\nAttributes, skills, level, and dynamic stats are all directly accessible via s3lf\nAll fields of self.type.stats.ai are available under s3lf\nAll fields from the original GameObject type are available under s3lf\nAll fields of the associated record are available under s3lf. Due to a name collision, the .id field of s3lf will always refer to GameObject.id and not the record's id. use s3lf.recordId to find the object's record name instead of the instance id.\nAll fields of the animation module are available under s3lf\nA new .record field is added to replace the .record function, which returns self.type.records[self.recordId]\nAn additional function, ConsoleLog is added which will display a given message in the ~ console from any context.\ns3lf is exported as an interface and immediately usable: local s3lf = require('openmw.interfaces').s3lf\nTo use it in the lua console, make sure the script is installed and enabled, then use luap or luas and try the following:\ns3lf objects may also construct other s3lf objects from normal GameObjects to gain the same benefits:\ns3lf also tracks combat targets on players, using the built-in openmw event, OMWMusicCombatTargetsChanged. All combat targets are stored in the table s3lf.combatTargets, and additionally the function s3lf.isInCombat() may be used to quickly determine whether a fight is currently happening. When a combat target is added or removed, either the event S3CombatTargetAdded or S3CombatTargetRemoved is sent to the player, with the actor whom is added or removed being the only argument provided to downstream eventHandlers.\nAll object types are represented as simple (lowercase) strings that you'd intuitively expect them to be, eg npc, miscellaneous, weapon, and so on.\nEvery s3lf object also includes a display() method, which will show a neatly-formatted output of all fields and functions currently used by this s3lf object:\ns3lf objects may call the display method anywhere they see fit, but the result will only be visible if a player is nearby (as it is printed to the console directly, using the nearby module to locate nearby players.)\nIf your mod uses the s3lf interface and it is not available, it is recommended you link back to the mod page in your error outputs so the user can get ahold of it themselves.\nProtectedTable\nA construct designed to make it easy to bind a game system, to a global OpenMW settings group. This makes it easy, for example, to make a setting group which scales actor health and reference it in all scripts with concise notation. For example:\nProtectedTables are usable in all contexts, except for MENU. Additionally, you may use I.S3ProtectedTable.help through the in-game (lua) console at any time for a detailed description of its usage. They will always be up-to-date with the settings group they're built on, as they contain a built-in subscribe function which will sync the values. If you wish, it is possible to override this subscribe function by using the subscribeHandler parameter of the constructor. subscribeHandler functions must match the ShadowTableSubscriptionHandler type definition.\nProtectedTables additionally come with a __tostring method that will show the manager name and all functions and methods associated with it. When building a script around a ProtectedTable, you may add as many new functions as you wish, but you may not add non-function fields. Additionally, to prevent invalidating the setting values the table tracks, the script will actually throw an error if you attempt to write directly to the table. To counteract this, all ProtectedTables include a state table which you may write to, and overwrite completely. The reason for this design is to allow flexible access to settings and to override each available function in the ProtectedTable on a case-by-case basis. If you create a protectedTable and use it as an interface, downstream modders may override the individual functions at their leisure without having to override your entire Interface.\nFinally, due to their nature, please keep in mind that ProtectedTables only work with global setting groups, not player ones. This is to ensure that all possible gameObjects have access to the various values in each group.\nScriptContext\nProvides an enum describing script contexts and a function to return the current one. Used by the LogMessage Function. Handy for when you would like for a given script or function to be usable regardless of what script context it is being ran in. ScriptContext is not available through an interface and must be required directly, since interfaces are naturally scopes anyway, and this is a somewhat niche usage.\nExample:\nLogMessage\nEmits a message to the ~ console from any context. Takes one argument. Re-exported through the s3lf module under the name ConsoleLog.\nExample:"},{"url":"https://DreamWeave-MP.github.io/S3ctors-S3cret-St4sh/hawk3ye/","title":"Hawk3ye","body":"Hawk3ye was inspired by Zoom To See.

No compromises, no bullshit, with a focus on scalability and extreme attention to performance optimization.\nI simply decided existing music solutions were not good enough after OpenMW's music system was dehardcoded. The underlying playlist mechanism used by OpenMW is very powerful - but due to a disagreement about playlist conflict resolution, the public API for music playlists was removed. Since that time, version 0.49 has straightforwardly not been living up to its true potential.\nS3maphore fixes that.

However, you can convert either to a S3maphore playlist in minutes by using this document.\nAny mods which simply add to or replace music Morrowind already provides (EG, in the Explore, Special, or Battle folders) are natively compatible with zero extra work.\nS3maphore ships a set of BAIN modules with Playlist Arrays which can be used in conjunction with tracks provided by other mods. Where appropriate, these modules are folder-based and will allow you to extend them yourself.\n01 Tamriel Rebuilt Playlists\n02 Project Cyrodiil Playlists\nUsage\nMake sure to install the playlist files and tracks for any S3maphore playlist arrays you install.

Presently, only English is supported, but translations are greatly welcomed!\nAlso in the settings menu, you can scroll through registered playlists and manually enable/disable them completely.\nTIP: If you can't toggle a playlist on or off, that means S3maphore couldn't find any of the tracks this playlist has registered in your game.\nFinally, pressing F8 will always skip the current track if one is playing - if the shift key is held when pressing F8, it will toggle music playback on or off entirely.\nS3maphore for Modders\nAs mentioned before, S3maphore is an open-ended system for playlist management. It is so open-ended, in fact, that you do not need to use S3maphore's built-in playlist management at all. Other playlist-related mods or plugins could easily be built on top of S3maphore's internal interface and provided events. This section of the docs will describe how to make your own playlists and interact with S3maphore's public methods and mechanisms.\nPlaylist Creation\nS3maphore's playlists are similar, but not identical, to existing solutions. There are some key differences, however:\nPlaylist Specification\nS3maphore playlist files are known as Playlist Arrays, because that's what they are. Every playlist file can return any number of playlists inside of table it sends back out. Every playlist must have both a string id and a priority field. id is the name of the playlist which is used as a table key, and priority is a number between 1 and 1000 indicating when the playlist should override others or be overridden by others. More on playlist priority below. Optional fields include:\ntracks - string[] - List of VFS paths to tracks to play. If using MUSE or Dynamic Music soundbanks as a base, the paths can be copied directly.\nactive - boolean - If false, this playlist will never be selected for playback. Defaults to true. See below for how to turn it on, if it's not actually enabled.\nrandomize - boolean - Whether to play tracks from this playlist in the actual written order or randomly. Defaults to false.\ncycleTracks - boolean - Whether to continue repeating the playlist after it has finished. Defaults to true.\nplayOneTrack - boolean - If true, the playlist will only play a single track and then deactivate itself. It must be reactivated using either the setPlaylistActive event or interface function in I.S3maphore. Defaults to false.\nisValidCallback - function(playback: Playback): boolean - A function which returns true/false to indicate whether or not a given playlist should run in this specific context. Only optional when using PlaylistPriority.Never\nfadeOut - number - optional duration for the fadeOut time between tracks in a playlist.\nsilenceBetweenTracks - PlaylistSilenceParams - Parameters for determining how long, if at all, fake silence tracks are used in a playlist. See below for a more detailed description of the PlaylistSilenceParams type.\ninterruptMode - InterruptMode - This field determines whether or not a playlist may be interrupted by another, based on the archetypes used by vanilla playlists. Valid values are INTERRUPT.Me, INTERRUPT.Other, and INTERRUPT.Never.\nfallback - PlaylistFallback - Selection of fallback tracks and playlists which can be used alongside this playlist. See below for details of the PlaylistFallback type.\nexclusions - S3maphorePlaylistExclusions - Selection of tracks and sub-directories which will NOT be played by this particular list\nS3maphore replaces OpenMW's builtin music script almost in its entirety. This means that conflicts between the two are mostly-impossible and limitations such as needing to manually set/know the duration of specific tracks is no longer necessary.\nS3maphore playlists do not have strictly defined rules, instead relying on the isValidCallback to allow each playlist to define its own rules in a very open-ended way. Every isValidCallback is passed a playback struct, which is a table containing two more tables: state, and rules.\nPlaylistState Specification\nAs usual, if there are more state values you'd like the PlaylistState to offer, please do share! A generic-enough use case can and absolutely will make the cut.\nrules is a table of functions that can have certain data passed into them to define when a S3maphore playlist should run. This is the real meat and potatoes of creating a S3maphorePlaylist. For exmaple:\nWARNING:\nTake note of the fact that the OuterRimCells table is declared and defined in an upper scope, outside of the isValidCallback function. This is crucial for S3maphore's lookup caching methods to work. Never inline a table constructor in your isValidCallbacks, or you will lose performance for no reason and trigger a memory leak. This is unavoidable on S3maphore's part, so it is paramount that you use it properly. NEVER make an isValidCallback that looks like this:\nTIP: If you don't want to specify track names manually, just don't! If no tracks are listed for a playlist, its id field is used to determine a folder name in which a playlist's tracks will be looked for. See the builtin playlists for an easy example:\nAbove is S3maphore's version of Morrowind's built-in Explore playlist. No tracks are listed, because it just randomly picks from Music/Explore, since Explore is the playlist id.\nPlaylistRules Specification\nAll of these functions may be chained, used, ignored, or even reimplemented by you, as long as your playlist's isValidCallback returns true when it's supposed to play and false|nil when it isn't.\nNOTE:\nWhile S3maphore doesn't require that you use its built-in callbacks, your life will be easier if you do. S3maphore caches as many of its lookups as it possibly can, so one particular cell for example, will only really run the necessary code for these callbacks if it's never happened before.\nIn practice, this means most of the performance hit from S3maphore occurs during cell transitions. Increased usage will also occur durng combat as a much larger segment of the total number of registered playlist is iterated.\nOptimizing your playlists is important!\nS3maphore works by calling every isValidCallback, for every playlist which is marked as active and has at least one track, every single frame. This is why the caching is necessary, and why it's important to keep your isValidCallbacks simple where you can.\nUse S3maphore's open ended nature to your advantage, but please keep in mind that every playlist is running its callbacks every single frame. You are sharing not-a-lot of space with a lot of neighbors who are very much in a hurry.\nIf you do run into performance bottlenecks with your playlists, please let me know and I will do everything I can to help make your playlists functional. Later iterations of S3maphore are likely to rely on my helper library, H3lp Yours3lf, for additional optimizations!\nPlaylist Environment Specification\nStarting from version 0.54 and onward, S3maphore provides a builtin environment to playlists which can be used to simplify the creation of playlists.\nFor example, a playlist which used to look like this:\nMay now be:\nThe idea is to provide a bunch of built-in variables and functions to playlists so that it is no longer necessary for every playlist to require the same things every other one does. S3maphore's built-in event handling functions and tilesets are provided through this environment, as well as openmw.interfaces, and many builtin lua functions you otherwise would not have access to.\nThe environment is easily extensible through the core.lua which creates it, so please feel free to request new functions here.\nFull playlist environment specification:\nThe Special Playlist\nThe Special playlist is, well, a special case - it comes with no tracks, and is the ONLY playlist which is allowed to do so intentionally. Playing a special track using either the below events or interfaces will play the specified track, once, and then fall back to whatever playback behavior is contextually appropriate. This can be useful for playing things like boss music, or the levelup sting.\nPlaylist Localization\nAll S3maphore playlists natively support being localized, thanks to OpenMW's use of the l10n system. To provide localizations for a playlist, make a folder adjacent to your playlists folder, called l10n. Inside of that, make another folder called, S3maphoreTracks${PLAYLIST_ID}. For example, the builtin music playlists are in S3maphoreTracksExplore and S3maphoreTracksBattle. You'll see localized versions of track and playlist names onscreen as they change, if you have the BannerEnabled setting enabled.\nEvents\nS3maphore includes a selection of Player events which indicate the changing of tracks and responds to some to modify its behavior.\nS3maphoreSkipTrack - () - skips the current track\nS3maphoreToggleMusic - ({ state: boolean }) - set whether music plays or not. Will immediately stop playback when disabling.\nS3maphoreSetPlaylistActive - ({ playlist: string, state: boolean }) - Enables or disables a playlist\nS3maphoreSpecialTrack - ({ trackPath: string, reason: S3maphoreTrackChangeReason }) - plays one specific track from the special playlist which will not be interrupted, but may be overridden by other playlists in the Special priority class.\nS3maphoreTrackChanged - (S3maphoreStateChangeEventData) - Emitted whenever the currently playing track changes, due to the previous one being skipped, or a new playlist starting, or a new track from the same playlist starting.\nS3maphoreMusicStopped - ({ reason: S3maphoreTrackChangeReason }) - Emitted when music stops, due to being disabled, no playlist being valid for this frame, or just the player dying.\nS3maphoreStateChangeEventData Specification\nSee the interface documentation immediately below for the S3maphoreTrackChangeReason specification.\nInterface\nIf you need more direct control over what S3maphore is doing, it also offers an interface in Player scope, I.S3maphore. This is especially useful for debugging S3maphore via the console, as almost all of its important playlist-related functionality is exposed through this interface. The S3maphoreSkipTrack, S3maphoreToggleMusic, S3maphoreSetPlaylistActive, and S3maphoreSpecialTrack events are all shorthands for calling functions in this interface.\nThe various functions available are as follows:\nSettings\nS3maphore's main settings group is a Player scoped storage section called SettingsS3Music. It contains the following keys and values:\n1.Enable Debug Messages - Checkbox - Whether or not to use verbose logging. Press F10 in-game or veiew openmw.log for more details. Every line with S3maphore log outputs will start with [ S3MAPHORE ]:\nEnable Music - Checkbox - Whether or not S3maphore will play music at all, for the purposes of temporarily stopping playback to be managed by something else\nShow Track Info - Checkbox - Whether or not the current playlist and track names will be shown when S3maphore changes songs.\nEnable Combat Music - Checkbox - If this is disabled, combat music will never play. Added by request.\nFinish Previous Track - Checkbox - Enabled by default, this setting prevents playlist changes with the same interrupt mode from interrupting music playback.\nAllow Friendly Interior Playlist Override - Checkbox - disabled by default, this setting allows overriding the finish previous track setting, when entering a friendly interior, such as a tavern.\nAllow Dungeon Playlist Override - Checkbox - enabled by default, overrides the finish previous track setting when entering a dungeon.\nAllow Overworld Playlist Override - Checkbox - disabled by default, allows playlist changes while traversing exteriors to override one another. May be removed in a later version as this was the main reason Finish Previous Track was implemented in the first place.\nDefault Fade Duration - Number - Global fadeOut duration used between tracks if a playlist doesn't specify its own.\nEnable Silence Tracks - Checkbox - Enabled by default, allows S3maphore to stop music playback for a specified amount of time between track changes in the same playlist.\nGlobal Silence Chance - Number - Defaults to 0.15, this is the global chance for silence tracks to play. If a playlist specifies this value itself, that is used instead.\nExplore Silence Min Duration - Number - Minimum duration for playback to stop between tracks, during Explore playlists. Randomly selected between this and the maximum value.\nExplore Silence Max Duration - Number - Maximum duration for playback to stop between tracks, during Explore playlists. Randomly selected between this and the minimum value.\nBattle Silence Min Duration - Number - Minimum duration for playback to stop between tracks, during Battle playlists. Randomly selected between this and the maximum value.\nBattle Silence Max Duration - Number - Maximum duration for playback to stop between tracks, during Battle playlists. Randomly selected between this and the minimum value.\nThere also is another Player scoped storage section of note - S3maphoreActivePlaylistSettings. All playlists registered by S3maphore can have their active states set by other scripts by setting the key ${PLAYLISTNAME}Active to true or false. S3maphore will then automatically respond to this change and disable/enable the playlist accordingly. Every playlist can also be permanently toggled on or off in the settings menu manually.\nCreditsAll code in this repository was generated by Dave Corley under the GPL3 License.Please enjoy my content, hack away as you please, and respect the freedoms of your fellow creators in the meantime.All code was written by Dave Corley under the GPL3 license.

Each enemy has five phases from full to wounded to dead, with the actual icon color mixing between the two nearest colors. This means you always know how healthy the enemy is in combat!\nTarget indicators also grow in size dynamically according to how far away your target is. Additionally, it is impossible to target enemies which are offscreen, and the mod does not use any raycasts unless the CheckLOS setting is enabled - what this means for you is no bad targets, and high performance (as much as can be expected from updating a UI element every frame, anyway).\nT4rg3t5 comes with a full suite of 31 icons to use for lock-on indicators. Additionally, it's very easy to create new target lock icons for T4rg3t5 for your own mods or personal use.\nPlease make sure to assign a keybinding for T4rg3t5 to use, or the mod will be (mostly) useless.\nCore Features\nSmart Target Acquisition\nAutomatic Target Selection: Finds the nearest valid enemy in your field of view\nLine-of-Sight Checking: Ensures targets are actually visible and not behind obstacles\nFlick Switching: Quickly change targets by flicking the mouse left or right\nCombat Auto-Lock: Automatically locks onto enemies who initiate combat with you\nVisual Target Indicators\nDynamic Lock Icons: Customizable target markers that scale with distance\nHealth-Based Coloring: Icon color changes based on enemy health status:\nFull Health (100%+): Primary color\nVery Healthy (80-100%): Mix with full health color\nHealthy (60-80%): Distinct healthy state\nWounded (40-60%): Noticeable wound indication\nVery Wounded (20-40%): Critical condition warning\nDead/Dying (0-20%): Near death state\nHit Feedback: Icons \"bounce\" when you successfully hit locked targets\nDistance Scaling: Icons grow/shrink based on target distance\nIntelligent Automation\nAuto-Facing: Character automatically turns to face locked targets\nWeapon Awareness: Only allows locking when wielding weapons\nSmart Target Management:\nAutomatically switches targets when current target dies\nBreaks lock when targets move out of sight\nReleases lock when sheathing weapons\nFor Modders\nEvents\nTarget locking always happens by way of sending an event. If you wish to modify this behavior somehow, you may create an eventHandler for the S3TargetLockOnto event. This will allow you to prevent target locking in some circumstances, change the target, do some specific behavior when a target is locked, etc. In the eventData is only the targeted actor, which is nil if the target lock has been broken for any reason.\nTriggers\nYou can also engage target locking manually from any PLAYER script by calling input.activateTrigger('S3TargetLockOn'). This will either disable or enable locking as appropriate.\nIf you care to check whether a target is already selected or not, then use I.S3LockOn.Manager.getMarkerVisibility().\nProtectedTable\nT4rg3t5 uses H3lp Yours3lf's protected table interface, which offers many conveniences - such as displaying all the associated setting values by simply trying to print the table.

MTM attempts to bridge the gap, by making it easy to create and use tags for classifying objects - like, which cells are dungeons, or merchants, or distinguishing bandages from regular medical supplies, etc.\nEnd users will need this as a dependency of other mods (hopefully), but it doesn't do much of anything in itself. Read on past the installation guide for developer's notes.\nUsing Tags\nTags are stored as yaml files under the subdirectory ModTags of any data= entry in openmw.cfg. When properly installed, Tagger includes a (hopefully growing) built-in set of tag definitions for the vanilla plugins, as well as some popular mods. Contributions to Tagger's built-in tags and associations are welcome and desired. The rest of this category will describe how to create tags and attach them to any object desired. This includes cells, quests, objects in the game world, or whatever other thing you can represent as a string in Lua.\nYaml Schema\nEvery Tagger definition file should have either or both of the following fields:\ntags is a list of tag names to be used. It might look like this:\nThese will then be made available to other modders through the Tagger interface.\napplied_tags is a map of tagged objects to the list of tags they actually use. Multiple mods may add as many tags as they wish to the same object as many times as they like. Tags may not be removed by design.\nWhen Tagger is loaded, all tags are loaded immediately and made available in all script contexts. Tags are stored inside of a global storage section which only lives through the length of your play session.\nThis means that Tagger doesn't occupy unnecessary space in your save file, is always as up to date as it can be, and can be used by any object in the game. Also, note that it's not necessarily a requirement that tags are associated with a specific gameObject. You can apply tags to anything you can represent as a string in a yaml file, so feel free to make up your own associations, such as with quests or even specific MWScripts.\nAPI\nFor scripters whom are not creating their own tag definitions but derivative scripts (you can do both!) there are mostly four values you'd care about.\nGlobal scripts can access Tagger's features through I.TaggerG, whereas all other scripts can access them through I.TaggerL. Both the global list of tags and all applied tags are available as the values I.TaggerL.TagList or I.TaggerL.AppliedTags. Calls to these functions normalize your inputs, so don't worry about case sensitivity.\nYou can check if an object has a tag, or read its entire tag list like so:\nI.TaggerL.objectHasTag(self, \"NPCMainQuest\")\nI.TaggerL.objectTags(self)"},{"url":"https://DreamWeave-MP.github.io/S3ctors-S3cret-St4sh/talk_to_the_hand/","title":"Talk To The H4ND","body":""},{"url":"https://DreamWeave-MP.github.io/S3ctors-S3cret-St4sh/toolgun/","title":"Toolgun","body":"Toolgun is a port of the eponymous swiss-army-revolver from Garry's Mod, purpose built for OpenMW.

The entire table of tool modes is exposed through the interface toolTime, and modders may add their own tool modes through the member tools. In mode.lua, modders can find the base tool object for making their own.\nToolgun also offers a hand-built JSON serializer that players can use to make their own mods using it (almost) as simply as possible. Just go do some stuff with it, save your game, and hit F10. You'll have a single (possibly, extremely long) line of text you can copy into a new document. Do so, and name it whatever.json. Then you can feed that file into tes3conv (specifically, version 0.0.10), and now you've got a new mod.\nHow hard was that?\nUsage\nPlease keep in mind that Toolgun requires OpenMW version 0.49, or at time of writing, a development build.\nLinux users may (probably) find development builds through their respective package managers, or failing all else, check out JohnnyHostile's AppImages.\nControls\nMany controls in toolgun are mode-specific. However, there are a small handful of (hardcoded, I am not changing this until default keybinds are properly implemented) controls which apply to all modes:\n'X' - this increases the magnitude of your current edit mode. Eg, in scale mode, this will increase the amount by which the object's scale is increased.\n'Z' - this decreases the magnitude of your current edit mode. Eg, in scale mode, this will decrease the amount by which the object's scale is decrease.\nCtrl + 'X', 'Y', or 'Z' - this will lock certain actions to a given axis. For example, if using the move submode, pressing Ctrl-Z will ensure the object only moves on the Z axis. Not applicable for every submode.\nCtrl + 'C' - This cycles between tool modes.\nJust pressing C will allow switching between submodes of certain tools, such as clone.\nOtherwise, just equip the toolgun and fire to activate it.\nBuilt-in Tools\nScale - Use this to increase or decrease the size of objects. WARNING: Scaling an object below 0.5 or above 2.0 violates Bethesda's usage of the ESP format, and so, extreme object scales will not work when trying to save them with tes3conv. Sorry.\nDelete - Self-explanatory.\nHowever, if you press Shift+Z when using the delete submode, you can replace any object you remove accidentally.\nClone - Use this submode to copy or cut objects from the game world. Hold shift when shooting an object to delete the original and save it to your clipboard.\nSwitch submodes to go between copy and paste\nGrab - As it says on the tin, use the grab submode to move objects around.\nFree - No special constraints on object movement. Just drag the thing directly in front of your camera while left mouse is held down.\nAxis - Use with the above mentioned axis-locking commands to restrict movement to a specific axis\nGround - Use this submode to drop objects onto the ground using a raycast.\nPoint - In this submode, you can bind two objects together. First, shoot wherever you want your object to go. Then, shoot the object you want to move. The second object will snap to whatever the first point you shot was, and you can continue from there.\nRotate - Just rotates objects around. Quite unwieldy when rotating on all three axes, so highly recommended to lock rotation to a specific axis.\nCredits\nAuthor: S3ctor\nAll code was written by S3ctor.\nFacepunch owns the original Toolgun mesh.\nSFX are sourced from Valve in accordance with their mod content policy for non-commercial products."},{"url":"https://DreamWeave-MP.github.io/S3ctors-S3cret-St4sh/transmog/","title":"Transmog Menu","body":"The Transmog Menu is originally derived from Cosmetic Overrides for MWSE.
